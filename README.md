# History: Windows Vista Bingo Whiteboard
Intention: Preserve a piece of software history  

The image below shows a bingo table with excuses, code auditors anticipated to hear, while they audited Windows Vista.  
Since the hand writing isn't readable on some spots, I transcripted it to a readable format.
